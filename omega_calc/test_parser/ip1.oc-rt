# Omega Calculator v2.1 (based on Omega Library 2.1, July, 2008):
# time {[a,b,c,d,e,f] :
# 	   a+b+2c+2d+e+2f >= 1
# 	&& a - 3b - 2f >= 1
# 	&& 3a-b >= 1
# 	&& a-c >= 1
# 	&& -b-3c+2e-2f >= 1
# 	&& -a-2e>=1
# 	&& b-2d-f >= 1
# 	&& 4a+b-e >= 1
# 	&& a-c+e >= 1
# 	&& a >= 1
# 	};

Times (in microseconds): 
    4 us to copy original set of constraints
  137 us to do the default amount of simplification, obtaining: 
	{[a,b,c,d,e,f]: a <= -2e-1 && b <= 3a-1 && 1 <= a+b+2c+2d+e+2f && 3b+2f < a && c < a+e && b+3c+2f < 2e && 2d+f < b}

 4709 us to do the maximum (i.e., excessive) amount of simplification, obtaining: 
	{[a,b,c,d,e,f]: a <= -2e-1 && b <= 3a-1 && 1 <= a+b+2c+2d+e+2f && 3b+2f < a && c < a+e && b+3c+2f < 2e && 2d+f < b}

WARNING: The Omega calculator was compiled with options that force
it to perform additional consistency and error checks
that may slow it down substantially

NOTE: These times relect the time of the current _implementation_
of our algorithms. Performance bugs do exist. If you intend to publish or 
report on the performance on the Omega test, we respectfully but strongly 
request that send your test cases to us to allow us to determine if the 
times are appropriate, and if the way you are using the Omega library to 
solve your problem is the most effective way.

Also, please be aware that over the past two years, we have focused our 
efforts on the expressive power of the Omega library, sometimes at the
expensive of raw speed. Our original implementation of the Omega test
was substantially faster on the limited domain it handled.

	Thanks,
